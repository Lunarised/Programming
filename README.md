<h1> Howdy </h1>
<p> My name is Lunarised and this is my Git Repository where i work on
some programming exersises.</p>
<h2> What Languages do i use? </h2>
<p>I am currently learning how to effectively use C89, with the goal of using it as my main language
for any imperative programming. I am also rather proficient in Java, C# and C++. My future goals are to learn how to use Prolog, Haskell, Common Lisp and Perl </p>
<h2> Current Projects </h2>
<p>My Current Projects are to rewrite most of my university exercises to a point where i am happy with them, and also to work on any given tasks for my BIT</p>

<h2> Currently Learning </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Ansi - C </li>
  <li> Perl </li>
  <li> Scheme </li>
  <li> Rust </li>
  <li> Idris </li>
 </ul>


<h2> Rust </h2>
<p> I am still a complete beginner at rust as of September 2019 but i plan for it to become my plain default language </p>

<h2> Perl </h2>
<p> I am comfortable enough with perl to write basic OS level scripting, but in the future, I would like to become better </p>

<h2> Scheme </h2>
<p> Making Progress on S99 problems </p>

<h2> Idris </h2>
<p> Still waiting on Idris 2 </p>

<h2> ANSI-C </h2>
<p> The most proficient of the languages I am still learning, but im still progressing with it </p>


<h2> Proficient Languages </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Java 7/8 </li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>C++ 11</li>
	<li>C# </li>
</ul>
<h2> Java </h2>
<p> I spend many years of my degree taming Java to my liking, enough so
that it is one of the fastest languages for me to do a mockup program in.</p>
	
<p>While I do not use many of the OO Principles Java has to offer, I still use it for
its platform capability and its inheritance model </p>

<h2> Python </h2>
<p> Ive done my fair share of computing and mathematical analysis with this language with
a dabble of Genetic Algorithms and OO python thrown in for good measure. Not my goto language,
 mainly due to its styling, but hey. Its not the worst one out there atleast! </p>
 
 <h2> C# </h2>
 <p> For all my graphical interface needs for windows systems, I use C#. Not much to say
 Its fast enough for my purposes, although, as i seldom run windows, I find myself writing
 in it less and less </p>
 
 <h2> C++ </h2>
 <p> Although this language is heavily disliked by my programming hero, Richard O'Keefe, I still
use it a little, as its just Java without as many restrictions. Ive built a few roguelikes and puzzles
in this language using .net.  Its far from my favorite language but i try to keep upto date with it </p>
